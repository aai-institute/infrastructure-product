## Installation
For development in the backend you need the client, `job-queue` as an editable dependency.
The installation via the `requirements-dev.txt` depends on setting the `PROJECT_ROOT` environment variable you can set with executing
```bash
export PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)
```
in the backend folder.
